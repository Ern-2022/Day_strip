# Day_strip
I will use as main datetime library, when developing the program I can add other libraries. This program will subtract days in the one year to show how many days, hours and seconds are left until your birthday ðŸ¥³

from datetime import datetime ,timedelta
from time import sleep

agora = datetime.now()
